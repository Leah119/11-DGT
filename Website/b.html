            <p>The B-Block is a block of the school that hosts the year 8 classes. It also has the school library, a courtyard, and a common room. This area is a common place for year 8 students to stay around, as it is where their homerooms are centred. During break times, many students from other years will also be in this area, as the library is a popular spot to be during interval and lunch. There is also a science lab in this area, that is used by classes of all years.</p>
            <p>A list of the classes in this block include: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B9, B10, B11, B12.</p>
