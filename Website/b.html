            <p class="text">The B-Block is a block of the school that hosts the year 8 classes. It also has the school library, a courtyard, and a common room. This area is a common place for year 8 students to stay around, as it is where their homerooms are centred. During break times, many students from other years will also be in this area, as the library is a popular spot to be during interval and lunch. There is also a science lab in this area, that is used by classes of all years.</p>
            <p class="text">A list of the classes in this block include:</p>
            <p class="text">B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B9, B10, B11, B12.</p>
            <p class="text">B1, B3, B9, and B12 are all year 8 homeroom classrooms. Two of these are accessible from inside the common room, whereas the other two (B1 and B12) are accessible from outside. There is a teacher workroom inside the common room as well, where all year 7 and year 8 homeroom teachers will be located. B10 is another lab that is in the junior block, and is used by all years.</p>
