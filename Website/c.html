            <p class="text">C-block is the ex-technologies block of the school. It currently holds a science lab, a new drama room, and a room that is under construction! The new rooms are being built in the old food tech room, and will be used as junior classrooms. Most of the classrooms are currently not in use, except for the science lab (C8), the distance room (C9), and the new drama room (C3). There is a lot of excitement over what the new classrooms will hold!</p>
