            <p class="text">C-block is the ex-technologies block of the school. It currently holds a science lab, a new drama room, and a room that is under construction! The new rooms are being built in the old food tech room, and will be used as junior classrooms. Most of the classrooms are currently not in use, except for the science lab (C8), the distance room (C9), and the new drama room (C3). There is a lot of excitement over what the new classrooms will hold!</p>
            <p class="text">A list of the classes in this block include: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9.</p>
            <p class="text">C1 is the old wood-work workroom, now that there are other workshops. C2, C4, C5, C6, and C7 are all unoccupied currently. C3 is the new drama classroom in this block. C9 is the distance office, and therefore not a classroom. C8 is a new science lab/classroom. </p>
