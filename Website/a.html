            <p>The A-Block is a block of the school primarily used for English classes, science labs, and the social sciences rooms. It also has an outdoor courtyard in its centre, and a small commonroom that contains microwaves, benches, and has bathrooms off its side. This area is generally marked as an area for senior students, as it is where their classes are centred, and where useful things such as lockers are kept. For junior areas, look at blocks "B" and "D".</p>
            <p>A list of the classes in this block include: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14, A15.</p>
            <p>Classes 2-4 are used mostly as english rooms, with english classes also beign held in A6 and A11. Etc, more about the different classes n=blah blah. Staff workroom as well blah blah.</p>
